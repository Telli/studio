"""Runs every script of Studio's examples (studio-sample/<id>/) with `cad run`, as their READMEs do, and says which
did not exit 0.

Each example is copied to a scratch folder first, so the run writes nothing into the example, and run from its
copy's root in the order its READMEs give: the models (each script declaring an `@model`), then `exports.py`, which
writes the files the rest read, then every other script (drawings, work instructions, checks). A script that takes
arguments on its command line (a probe its README gives arguments to) and the shared `sizes.py` are left out. The
motor mount's `checks/motor_plate_pmi.py` exits 1 unless the plate's PMI has every face covered and no annotation
unattached, so it is this run's PMI check too.

    text-to-cad/.venv/bin/python scripts/studio-samples-check.py [example ...]

The engine is the cad command's own unless CAD_STATE_DIR, CAD_CACHE_DIR and CAD_ENGINE_DIR are set: then the run
uses those folders (and CAD_ENGINE_PORT) and stops that engine when it ends. The engine listens on a loopback
port, so a sandbox that refuses local sockets refuses the run.
